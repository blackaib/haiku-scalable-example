Scalable reinforcement learning agents on container orchestration

## 1. Purpose of the project
Implement scalable reinforcement learning agent on the container orchestraion system like k8s.
We will use Deepmind's open sources like [haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku), [rlax](https://github.com/deepmind/rlax), [jax](https://github.com/google/jax)

## 2. Container Orchestraion
- [ ] Kubernetes (in-progress)
- [ ] Slurm
- [ ] Google Cloud Platform

## 3. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
- [ ] IMPALA (in-progress)

## 4. Architecture

This example will introduce a clear way to deploy scalable reinforcement learning agents to the computing clusters.
